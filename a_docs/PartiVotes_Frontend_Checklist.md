# PartiVotes Frontend Implementation Checklist

This checklist tracks the step-by-step implementation of the PartiVotes frontend, aiming for a functional UI and mocked wallet connection based on the documentation.

**Status:** [ ] Incomplete, [x] Complete

**Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundational Elements**

*   [x] **1.1 Verify Project Structure:** Ensure the basic React project exists (`/home/partivotes/partivotes`) and contains `public/` and `src/` directories.
*   [x] **1.2 Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/x-date-pickers date-fns react-router-dom`.
*   [x] **1.3 Create Directory Structure:** Create the necessary subdirectories within `src/` as outlined in the docs: `components/layout`, `components/wallet`, `components/polls`, `components/common`, `contexts`, `services`, `utils`, `styles`.
*   [x] **1.4 Implement Theme:** Create `src/styles/theme.js` and paste the theme configuration from the docs.
*   [x] **1.5 Setup `index.jsx`:** Update/Create `src/index.jsx` (or `index.js`) to include `ThemeProvider`, `LocalizationProvider`, `CssBaseline`, and `BrowserRouter` wrapping the `App` component, as shown in the docs.

**Phase 2: Core Layout**

*   [x] **2.1 Create `Header.jsx`:** Implement the `Header` component in `src/components/layout/Header.jsx` with the basic structure (AppBar, Toolbar, Title linking to home). Leave nav links/wallet button for later.
*   [x] **2.2 Create `Footer.jsx`:** Implement the `Footer` component in `src/components/layout/Footer.jsx`.
*   [x] **2.3 Create `Layout.jsx`:** Implement the `Layout` component in `src/components/layout/Layout.jsx`, integrating `Header`, `Footer`, and the main `Container` for children content.
*   [x] **2.4 Update `App.jsx`:** Update `src/App.jsx` (or `App.js`) to use the `Layout` component. Keep routing minimal for now (e.g., just a root path).

**Phase 3: Common Utility Components**

*   [x] **3.1 Create `LoadingSpinner.jsx`:** Implement `src/components/common/LoadingSpinner.jsx`.
*   [x] **3.2 Create `ErrorAlert.jsx`:** Implement `src/components/common/ErrorAlert.jsx`.
*   [x] **3.3 Create `ConfirmationDialog.jsx`:** Implement `src/components/common/ConfirmationDialog.jsx`.
*   [x] **3.4 Create `NotFound.jsx`:** Implement `src/components/common/NotFound.jsx`.

**Phase 4: Wallet Integration Setup**

*   [x] **4.1 Create `WalletContext.jsx`:** Create the file `src/contexts/WalletContext.jsx`. Implement the basic context structure (`createContext`, initial state variables: `connected`, `address`, `balance`, `loading`, `error`). Export `WalletContext` and `WalletProvider`.
*   [x] **4.2 Create `walletService.js`:** Create `src/services/walletService.js`. Define the function signatures (`connectWallet`, `disconnectWallet`, `getWalletAddress`, `getWalletBalance`, etc.) as placeholders for now. Include the `USE_MOCK_WALLET` flag check as suggested in the docs.
*   [x] **4.3 Integrate `WalletProvider`:** Wrap the `Layout` component in `src/App.jsx` with the `WalletProvider`.

**Phase 5: Wallet UI & Connection Logic (Mocked)**

*   [x] **5.1 Create `WalletStatus.jsx`:** Implement `src/components/wallet/WalletStatus.jsx`.
*   [x] **5.2 Create `WalletConnect.jsx`:** Implement `src/components/wallet/WalletConnect.jsx`. Use `useContext(WalletContext)` to get state. Implement the Button/Menu structure. Add placeholders/mock logic for `handleConnect` and `handleDisconnect` that call the (currently mocked) `connect` and `disconnect` functions from the context.
*   [x] **5.3 Integrate `WalletConnect` in `Header.jsx`:** Import and add the `WalletConnect` component to the `Header.jsx`.
*   [x] **5.4 Implement `WalletContext` Logic:** Flesh out the `WalletContext.jsx`.
    *   Implement the `connect`, `disconnect`, `refreshBalance` functions using `useCallback`. These should call the corresponding (mocked) functions in `walletService.js` and update the context state (`setConnected`, `setAddress`, etc.).
    *   Implement the `useEffect` hooks to check initial connection status and potentially poll for balance changes (using mocked service calls).
*   [x] **5.5 Implement Mock Logic in `walletService.js`:** Add the mock implementations for `connectWallet`, `getWalletAddress`, `getWalletBalance`, `disconnectWallet` when `USE_MOCK_WALLET` is true (return mock address, balance, update a simulated connection state).
*   [x] **5.6 Setup `.env` for Mocking:** Create a `.env` file in the root `/home/partivotes/partivotes/` and add `REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_DATA=true`.
*   [x] **5.7 Test Wallet Connect/Disconnect:** Run the application and test the Connect/Disconnect flow using the mock data. Verify the UI updates correctly.

**Phase 6: Routing & Basic Poll Pages Setup**

*   [x] **6.1 Create Utility Files:**
    *   Create `src/utils/constants.js` and add a placeholder `export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'mock_contract_address';`.
    *   Create `src/utils/dateUtils.js` and implement the `formatDate` function.
*   [x] **6.2 Create `pollService.js`:** Create `src/services/pollService.js`. Implement the mock data function `getMockPolls()` and the mock `waitForConfirmation()` function. Define the service function signatures (`createPoll`, `getPolls`, `getPoll`, `voteWithSignature`, `voteWithMPC`, `endPoll`) using the mock data/logic when `REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_DATA` is true.
*   [x] **6.3 Create Poll Page Components (Structure Only):** Create the files for `PollList.jsx`, `PollCreate.jsx`, `PollDetail.jsx`, `VoteForm.jsx`, `PollResults.jsx` in `src/components/polls/`. Add basic component structure (import React, export default function).
*   [x] **6.4 Configure `App.jsx` Routes:** Update the `<Routes>` in `src/App.jsx` to include paths for `/`, `/create`, `/poll/:id`, and a wildcard `*` route pointing to the respective components (`PollList`, `PollCreate`, `PollDetail`, `NotFound`).

**Phase 7: Poll Component Implementation (UI & Mock Data)**

*   [x] **7.1 Implement `PollList.jsx` UI:** Implement the UI according to the docs, fetching mock data using `getPolls` from `pollService.js`, handling loading/error states, displaying polls as cards, and linking to detail/create pages. Ensure the "Create Poll" button is disabled if the (mocked) wallet is not connected.
*   [x] **7.2 Implement `PollCreate.jsx` UI:** Implement the form UI (TextFields, DateTimePicker, options management). Add basic validation logic (checking required fields, option count, date). Display the required MPC cost and current (mock) balance. Disable submit if wallet disconnected or balance insufficient.
*   [x] **7.3 Implement `PollDetail.jsx` UI:** Implement the UI to fetch mock poll data using `getPoll(id)`, display title, description, creator, expiration. Conditionally render `VoteForm` or `PollResults` based on poll status and whether the user has (mock) voted. Add creator actions (End Poll button).
*   [x] **7.4 Implement `VoteForm.jsx` UI:** Implement the radio button group for options. Implement the "Vote" button and the dialog for choosing public (signature) or private (MPC) voting.
*   [x] **7.5 Implement `PollResults.jsx` UI:** Implement the UI to display total, public, and private vote counts, and the breakdown per option with progress bars, using the mock data from the `poll` prop.
*   [x] **7.6 Connect `PollCreate` Logic:** Wire the form submission in `PollCreate.jsx` to call the mock `createPoll` function in `pollService.js`. Handle loading state and navigation on success/error.
*   [x] **7.7 Connect `VoteForm` Logic:** Wire the public/private vote buttons in `VoteForm.jsx` to call the mock `voteWithSignature` / `voteWithMPC` functions. Pass the result back to `PollDetail` via `onVoteSuccess`. Handle loading/error states.
*   [x] **7.8 Connect `PollDetail` Logic:** Wire the "End Poll Early" button and confirmation dialog to call the mock `endPoll` function. Update the poll state locally on success. Implement the logic to check if the current user has voted (based on mock data/address).

**Phase 8: Final Review & Refinement**

*   [x] **8.1 Code Review:** Review all created/modified components against the implementation guide in the documentation.
    * Note: Fixed issue with `getWalletBalance` function in `PollCreate.jsx` - replaced with `refreshBalance` from WalletContext.
*   [x] **8.2 Functional Testing (Mock):** Test all user flows: viewing polls, creating a poll, viewing details, voting (public/private), viewing results, ending a poll (as creator), handling errors, loading states, and wallet connection status throughout the app using the mock data.
    * Note: Encountered and fixed issues with React Router and date-fns package compatibility.
*   [x] **8.3 Cleanup:** Remove unnecessary console logs.
*   [x] **8.4 Verify `.env`:** Double-checked `REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_DATA=true` is set for this phase.

**Phase 9: Deployment Preparation**

*   [x] **9.1 Build Test:** Run `npm run build` to ensure the application builds successfully without errors.
    * Note: Build completed successfully with only minor warnings about unused variables.
*   [x] **9.2 Serve Test:** Test the production build locally using `npm run serve`.
    * Note: Set up systemd service for automatic startup on reboot.
*   [x] **9.3 Documentation:** Update README.md with setup instructions, features, and usage examples.
    * Note: Added installation script for systemd service.
*   [x] **9.4 Final Cleanup:** Remove any remaining TODOs, console.logs, and commented-out code.
    * Note: Fixed issue with disappearing poll details after voting or creating polls by using localStorage and removing automatic redirects.

**Phase 10: Final Verification**

*   [x] **10.1 End-to-End Testing:** Perform a final walkthrough of all user flows to ensure everything works as expected.
    * Note: Completed comprehensive testing of all user flows - see e2e_test_results.md for details.
*   [x] **10.2 Performance Check:** Verify the application loads and responds quickly.
    * Note: Application loads in under 2 seconds and navigation is responsive.
*   [x] **10.3 Mobile Responsiveness:** Test the application on different screen sizes to ensure it's responsive.
    * Note: UI adapts well to small (320px), medium (768px), and large (1200px+) screen sizes.
*   [x] **10.4 Accessibility Check:** Verify that the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
    * Note: Verified proper heading hierarchy, color contrast, form labels, and keyboard accessibility.
