- Free signature-based public voting
- Private voting with 100 MPC payment
- Poll management (expiration, early ending)
- Data access functions

**File**: `/home/ubuntu/PartiVotes_SmartContract.rs`

## Development Workflow

The recommended development workflow for the PartiVotes platform is:

1. **Set up the development environment**:
   - Configure your Hetzner VPS using the VPS Configuration Guide
   - Use Windsurf IDE for development

2. **Implement the frontend**:
   - Follow the Frontend Implementation Guide
   - Focus on the wallet connection first
   - Implement the UI components
   - Test the frontend locally

3. **Deploy the frontend**:
   - Use the Installation Script to deploy the frontend
   - Test the deployed frontend

4. **Implement the smart contract**:
   - Use the Smart Contract as a starting point
   - Compile and deploy the contract to the Partisia Blockchain
   - Test the contract functionality

5. **Integrate the frontend with the smart contract**:
   - Update the frontend to interact with the deployed contract
   - Test the complete application

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the PartiVotes platform:

1. **Prepare your server**:
   - Set up a Hetzner VPS with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
   - Configure DNS to point your domain (partivotes.xyz) to your server's IP address

2. **Run the installation script**:
   - Upload the installation script to your server
   - Make it executable: `chmod +x install.sh`
   - Run it as root: `sudo ./install.sh`

3. **Deploy the smart contract**:
   - Compile the smart contract using the Partisia Contract Compiler
   - Deploy the compiled contract to the Partisia Blockchain
   - Update the `.env` file with the deployed contract address

4. **Test the application**:
   - Access your application at https://partivotes.xyz
   - Test all functionality

## Next Steps and Future Enhancements

Once you have the basic PartiVotes platform up and running, consider these enhancements:

1. **Smart Contract Improvements**:
   - Add more advanced voting mechanisms
   - Implement token-based governance
   - Add support for delegate voting

2. **Frontend Enhancements**:
   - Improve the UI design
   - Add analytics and statistics
   - Implement user profiles (if desired)

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement more robust signature verification
   - Add rate limiting
   - Enhance error handling

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement caching
   - Optimize database queries
   - Improve loading times

5. **Additional Features**:
   - Add support for different poll types
   - Implement notifications
   - Add social sharing capabilities

## Conclusion

The PartiVotes platform provides a solid foundation for a private voting system on the Partisia Blockchain. By following the provided documentation and implementation guides, you can build and deploy a functional voting platform that leverages the security and privacy features of Multi-Party Computation.

The modular design allows for easy extension and enhancement, making it possible to start with a simple proof of concept and gradually add more features as needed.
