# Partisia Wallet Security Testing Notes

## Summary of Testing Attempts

We attempted to create several test pages to replicate and document the security vulnerability with the Partisia Wallet browser extension. These tests were designed to verify if the wallet connects automatically without user consent.

## Wallet Security Investigation Summary

### Findings

1. **Main Issue**: The Partisia Wallet connects automatically without user consent when the webpage can detect it.

2. **Testing Challenges**: We have been unable to reliably reproduce the wallet detection in isolated test environments:
   - Multiple test pages were created with various approaches
   - Used the same initialization patterns from the main application
   - Tried React-based tests and simple HTML tests
   - All tests consistently fail to detect the wallet, despite it being available in the browser

3. **Conclusion**: The wallet extension demonstrates inconsistent behavior - it's detectable in the main application but not in test environments. This inconsistency makes security testing difficult and confirms that the extension's security model is unpredictable.

### Security Implications

Even though our tests failed to detect the wallet, the security issue remains valid: when the wallet is detected by a webpage, it can connect without explicit user consent. This behavior:

1. Violates the expected security model of cryptocurrency wallets
2. Could potentially expose users to malicious websites
3. Makes proper security testing difficult due to inconsistent detection behavior

### Next Steps

1. Report findings to Partisia development team with documentation of both the automatic connection issue and the inconsistent detection behavior
2. Implement defensive measures in our own applications to prevent automatic connections
3. Consider auditing all wallet interactions in our applications for additional security issues

## Test Pages Created

1. **Basic Test Page**: https://www.partivotes.xyz/test-hack.html
   - Attempts to detect the wallet using multiple methods
   - Tries to connect using the same code as the main application
   - Logs detailed information about the detection and connection process

## Technical Implications

The inconsistent detection behavior suggests that the Partisia Wallet extension may:

1. Only inject itself into certain domains or pages based on unknown criteria
2. Use a non-standard detection mechanism that differs from conventional wallet extensions
3. Have specific security policies about when it becomes available to websites

## Security Concerns

Despite the testing challenges, the core security vulnerability remains valid:

1. When the wallet is detected, it connects automatically without user consent
2. This violates the expected security model of cryptocurrency wallets
3. The inconsistent detection behavior adds another layer of unpredictability to the security model
