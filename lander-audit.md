- ‚ö†Ô∏è Nginx is proxying all traffic to the development server on port 3000
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the root cause of the routing issues in production

### React Context Findings
- ‚úÖ ThemeProvider is correctly implemented with proper state management
- ‚úÖ WalletProvider is correctly implemented with proper state management
- ‚úÖ Provider nesting order is correct
- ‚úÖ All context providers successfully wrap the application components
- ‚úÖ No issues identified with context consumers operating outside provider scope

## üîß Remediation Plan

Based on our comprehensive audit, we've identified multiple issues with the application's routing.

### Critical Issues
1. **React Router Context Issues**: 
   - Components using router hooks outside of Router context
   - Header component using useLocation() without proper Router context
   - Routes component using useRoutes() without proper Router context
   - Both errors appear as "Uncaught runtime errors:" in the console

2. **Component Structure Problems**: 
   - The application structure doesn't properly wrap all components with Router
   - Error occurs in both Header and Routes components
   - Component hierarchy: App > ThemeProvider > WalletProvider > Layout > Header/Routes
   - The Router component is not wrapping all components that use router hooks

3. **Specific React Router Errors**:
   - `useLocation()` may be used only in the context of a `<Router>` component
   - `useRoutes()` may be used only in the context of a `<Router>` component
   - These errors appear in both the home page and polls page (/polls URL)
   - Errors are displayed as "Uncaught runtime errors:" in red text

4. **Styled Components Warnings**:
   - Styled components are being created dynamically inside render methods
   - This can cause performance issues and styling inconsistencies
   - Affected components:
     - `styled.main` with ID `sc-jrcTuL` in Layout.js:126
     - `styled.div` with ID `sc-kDvujY` in Layout.js:121
     - `styled.div` with ID `sc-ipEyDJ` in Layout.js:126
   - Warnings appear with yellow triangle icons in the console

### Secondary Issues
1. **Development Server in Production**: While intentional, this approach requires careful handling of React Router
2. **Component Hierarchy**: The current component hierarchy doesn't ensure Router context is available everywhere needed
3. **Error Handling**: The application is missing proper error boundaries for React Router errors
   - React suggests adding error boundaries with link: https://reactjs.org/link/error-boundaries
4. **URL Structure**: The application is using /polls URL but has errors when accessing it directly
5. **Console Environment**: Errors are visible in the browser console with "Default levels" filter

### Recommended Fix - Fix React Router Implementation

#### Checklist for Implementation:

- [ ] **1. Analyze App Structure**: We need to analyze the component hierarchy to identify where the Router context is being lost.
  - The Router component in App.jsx needs to wrap all components that use router hooks
  - The Header component is using useLocation() but might be outside the Router context
  - Other components might be using router hooks outside the Router context

- [ ] **2. Fix Component Hierarchy**: Ensure that all components using router hooks are properly wrapped by the Router component.
  - Move the Router component higher in the component tree
  - Ensure Layout component is inside the Router, not outside
  - Check for components that might be rendered outside the Router context

- [ ] **3. Potential Solutions**:
  - Restructure App.jsx to ensure Router wraps everything
  - Move router-dependent components inside the Router context
  - Ensure no components using router hooks are rendered outside the Router

### Current Status - COMPLETE

The Nginx configuration has been updated to handle client-side routing correctly. React Router and styled components issues have been fixed and verified.

Applied fixes:
1. Restructured App.jsx to ensure the Router component properly wraps all components using router hooks:
   - Modified component hierarchy to ensure Router is the outermost wrapper
   - Placed ThemeProvider and WalletProvider inside Router component
   - Added clear code comments to prevent future regression

2. Fixed styled components warnings by moving component definitions outside of render functions:
   - Moved MainContainer and Content styled components outside of the Layout component
   - Eliminated dynamic creation of styled components during renders
   - Preserved all styling and functionality

These fixes resolved the following issues:
- ‚úÖ "useLocation() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component" error
- ‚úÖ "You may see this warning because you've called styled inside another component" warnings
- ‚úÖ All components now have proper access to router hooks

Application has been restarted with PM2 to apply these changes. Testing has confirmed that all issues are resolved.

### Completed Work Summary (March 30, 2025)

1. **Initial Audit**: Conducted a comprehensive audit of the application to identify the root cause of the routing issues.

2. **Environment Understanding**: Correctly identified that the application is intentionally running a development server in production, and Nginx is proxying to it.

3. **Nginx Configuration Update**: Modified the Nginx configuration to properly handle client-side routing while maintaining the development server approach:
   - Added a `try_files $uri @proxy;` directive to handle direct URL access
   - Created a named location `@proxy` to handle the proxying to the development server
   - Maintained all existing SSL settings

4. **React Router Fixes**: Ensured Router component properly wraps all components that use router hooks:
   - Restructured component hierarchy in App.jsx
   - Verified Header component now has access to router context
   - Confirmed useLocation() hook works correctly

5. **Styled Components Fixes**: Eliminated dynamic creation of styled components:
   - Moved styled component definitions outside the Layout component function
   - Preserved all styling and functionality

6. **Testing**: Verified all routes and functionality work correctly:
   - Direct access to root URL and /polls route
   - Navigation between pages
   - Page refreshes on all routes
   - No errors or warnings in console

7. **Documentation**: Updated this audit document with all fixes and verification steps.

### Recommendations for Future Maintenance

1. **Component Structure**: When adding new components that use router hooks, ensure they are rendered within the Router context in App.jsx.

2. **Styled Components**: Always define styled components outside of component functions to avoid runtime warnings and performance issues.

3. **Error Boundaries**: Consider adding React Error Boundaries to handle unexpected errors gracefully.

4. **Monitoring**: Periodically check the application logs for any new warnings or errors.

5. **Documentation**: Keep documenting the intentional use of a development server in production to prevent future confusion.
